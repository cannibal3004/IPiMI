# IPiMI

A simple board to allow you to connect a raspberry pi (or other micro controller) to the front panel connectors on a consumer PC Motherboard. Allow the connected device to control the power and reset buttons as well as read the state of the power and hdd leds from the motherboard.

**==Totally untested==**, designed with Gigabyte motherboards in mind. If you use this with another manufacturers board, you may need to modify the front panel connector.
