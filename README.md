# IPiMI

A simple board to allow you to connect a raspberry pi (or other micro controller) to the front panel connectors on a consumer PC Motherboard.
Totally untested, designed with Gigabyte motherboards in mind. If you use this with another manufacturers board, you may need to modify the front panel connector.
